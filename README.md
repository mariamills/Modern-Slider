# Modern Slider

This web component was created as a [contribution](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/webblocks-2022/pull/257) to [ZTM's webblocks-2022](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/webblocks-2022) for [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/) 2022. 

This component is a **modernized image slider** with a title, text and button. When slide pagination is clicked, it switches to the relevant slide and iterates on its own with a 12 second delay that can be modified in the js file by changing the value of the variable 'delay'.
